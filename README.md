# #Jumper description:
This jumper is a game when you have the obligation to keep your parachute up. Are you able to make it?
Or are you a perseverant person to strive? You are needed to guess the hidden word by guessing a letter one at a time.
If don't guess it correctly, you will lose your parachute a little by little, if you guess it correctly the parachute will be built up.
Remember that if you repeat your previous right guess, the parachute won't change.
But if you continue to repeat your wrong guess, you will lose again.
